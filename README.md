# 🤖 Machine Learning Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my Machine Learning Portfolio Repository.

This repository serves as a centralized index for my machine learning projects.  
Each project is implemented as a separate repository and demonstrates a complete end-to-end machine learning pipeline including data preprocessing, modeling, evaluation, and business insights.

The portfolio covers:

- Supervised Learning (Classification & Regression)
- Unsupervised Learning (Clustering)
- Model Evaluation & Comparison
- Business-Oriented Problem Solving
